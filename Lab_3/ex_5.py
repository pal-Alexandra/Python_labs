# TO DO
# 5. The validate_dict function that receives as a parameter a set of tuples
# ( that represents validation rules for a dictionary that has strings as keys and values) and a dictionary.
# A rule is defined as follows: (key, "prefix", "middle", "suffix").
# A value is considered valid if it starts with "prefix", "middle" is inside the value (not at the beginning or end) and ends with "suffix".
# The function will return True if the given dictionary matches all the rules, False otherwise.
