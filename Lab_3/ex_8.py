# 8. Write a function that receives a single dict parameter named mapping.
# This dictionary always contains a string key "start". Starting with the value
# of this key you must obtain a list of objects by iterating over mapping in the
# following way: the value of the current key is the key for the next value,
# until you find a loop (a key that was visited before).
# The function must return the list of objects obtained as previously described.
